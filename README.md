About Me
Hello! My name is Noel Allen and I currently work as a database manager in the insurance industry. I live in the Raleigh North Carolina area with my husband, and 2 dogs + 3 cats. Outside of data analytics, I enjoy running, reading and knitting. I am excited to be a part of the OMDS program at BU and look forward to expanding my knowledge of predictive analytics and machine learning.
